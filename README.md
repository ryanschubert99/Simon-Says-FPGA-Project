# Simon-Says-FPGA-Project
Abstract:

Using the DE10-Lite board the classic Simon memory game was implemented using Verilog code. The implementation keeps the playersâ€™ high score, the current score, and the game can go on for 40 rounds. The game does have an increased difficulty due to each round having different 16 possible inputs rather than just the 4 in the original game.
